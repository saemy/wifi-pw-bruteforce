# WiFi password brutforce
Searches for a WiFi network that uses an easy to guess password and connects to
it. In many countries passwords like ```12345678``` or ```88888888``` are very
popular, but finding the one access point that uses it amongst the ones that
don't is tedious.

## Usage
Currently, the script is targeted to Android. You need to have ```bash```, and
```wpa_cli``` installed.


Then, simply type as **root**:
```
wifi-pw-brutforce
```
